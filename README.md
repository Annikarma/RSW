WallStreetBets is an online community on the Reddit platform focused on exchanging information and strategies related to trading stocks, options and other financial instruments. 
The group was originally founded to position itself against hedge funds that were betting on certain stocks to fall.

The WallStreetBets API provides access to data and information from the WallStreetBets community on Reddit.

With this interface I retrieved the opinions on whether a stock is rising or falling and displayed them in the GUI to get a quick overview.
The column can be sorted by clicking on the column headings.
This little project was created after the first few weeks of C# lessons.
